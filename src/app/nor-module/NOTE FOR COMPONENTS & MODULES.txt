when you create a component in the angular normally, it's gonna have the standalone : true property in its decorator, make sure you remove that property from it, or else it'll create a conflict between angular's module structure and it's meaning of keeping the component independent,
hence if not removed, will not let you export it from the module


so after removing the property, add the exports array in the TS file of the module and also include the component in declared array.
